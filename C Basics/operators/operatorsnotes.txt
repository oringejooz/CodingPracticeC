C divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators

'Arithmetic operators'

+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

'Assignment Operators'

=	        x = 5	        x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	        x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
*=	        x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
/=	        x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	        x = x % 3	
&=	        x &= 3	        x = x & 3	
|=	        x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	        x = x << 3

'Comparison Operators'

return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0)

==	    Equal to	    x == y	    Returns 1 if the values are equal	
!=	    Not equal	    x != y	    Returns 1 if the values are not equal	
>	    Greater than	x > y	    Returns 1 if the first value is greater than the second value	
<	    Less than	    x < y	    Returns 1 if the first value is less than the second value	
>=	    Greater than or equal to	x >= y	    Returns 1 if the first value is greater than, or equal to, the second value	
<=	    Less than or equal to	    x <= y	    Returns 1 if the first value is less than, or equal to, the second value


'Logical Operators'

&& 	    Logical and	    x < 5 &&  x < 10	Returns 1 if both statements are true	
|| 	    Logical or	    x < 5 || x < 4	    Returns 1 if one of the statements is true	
!	    Logical not	    !(x < 5 && x < 10)	Reverse the result, returns 0 if the result is 1
